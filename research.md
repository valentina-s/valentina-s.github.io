### Sonar Data Analysis

I co-lead the [UW Echospace group](https://uw-echospace.github.io/), where I collaborate with oceanographers to combine data science, acoustics, mathematics, and software engineering to advance ocean acoustics research. Below are some topics of interest:

* matrix and tensor decomposition of long-term echosounder time series ([OOI Science Highlight](https://oceanobservatories.org/2021/03/a-bountiful-sea-of-data-making-echosounder-data-more-useful/) )
* supervised learning of fish aggregations in [acoustic surveys](https://uw-echospace.github.io/project/2021-hake-workflow/) 
* tools facilitating echosounder data workflows ([https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics))

Check out our group [https://uw-echospace.github.io/](https://uw-echospace.github.io/) to learn more about our group's work.

### Passive Acoustic Monitoring

I collaborate with the [Orcasound](https://www.orcasound.net/) organization on projects engaging the public in listening to underwater sounds through combining the efforts of AI and humans. Together we have participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works) program and have worked with many wonderful students from around the world to develop open source software and data sets. Read more on our experience [here](https://www.orcasound.net/portfolio/google-summer-of-code-open-source-software-for-students-orcas/). Below are more details on some of the projects:

* [OrcaAL Tool: Active Listening and Learning of Orca Sounds](https://orcasound.github.io/orcaal/)
* [Github Actions Workflows for Scheduled Algorithm Deployment](https://www.orcasound.net/author/dmitryvolodin/)
* [Sounds Similar for Me: Using Open Embeddings to Improve Sampling on OrcaAL Tool](https://www.orcasound.net/author/josegiraldo/)
