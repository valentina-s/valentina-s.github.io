I collaborate with the [Orcasound](https://www.orcasound.net/) organization on projects engaging the public in listening to underwater sounds through combining the efforts of AI and humans. Together we have participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works) program and have worked with many wonderful students from around the world to develop open source software and data sets. Read more on our experience [here](https://www.orcasound.net/portfolio/google-summer-of-code-open-source-software-for-students-orcas/). Below are more details on some of the projects:

* [OrcaAL Tool: Active Listening and Learning of Orca Sounds](https://orcasound.github.io/orcaal/)
* [Github Actions Workflows for Scheduled Algorithm Deployment](https://www.orcasound.net/author/dmitryvolodin/)
* [Sounds Similar for Me: Using Open Embeddings to Improve Sampling on OrcaAL Tool](https://www.orcasound.net/author/josegiraldo/)
* [Streaming External Hydrophones to Orcasound Website](https://www.orcasound.net/author/karan/)
* [Streamlining OrcaAL Tool](https://www.orcasound.net/author/benjamin/)
* [Bioacoustic Source Separation](https://www.orcasound.net/?s=devdoot)

I also work with masters students in the UW Master of Science in Data Science Program (as part of their capstones) on 
* [Underwater Acoustic Noise Estimates within the Puget Sound](https://github.com/orcasound/ambient-sound-analysis)
