I co-lead the [UW Echospace group](https://uw-echospace.github.io/), where I collaborate with oceanographers to combine data science, acoustics, mathematics, and software engineering to advance ocean acoustics research. Below are some topics of interest:

* matrix and tensor decomposition of long-term echosounder time series ([OOI Science Highlight](https://oceanobservatories.org/2021/03/a-bountiful-sea-of-data-making-echosounder-data-more-useful/) )
* supervised learning of fish aggregations in [acoustic surveys](https://uw-echospace.github.io/project/2021-hake-workflow/) 
* tools facilitating echosounder data workflows ([https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics))
