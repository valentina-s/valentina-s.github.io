Through the [Data Science & AI Accelerator](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/data-science-and-ai-accelerator/) (previously Incubator) program I have supported many researchers in their dive into using data-intensive methods to extract information from complex and messy datasets and many of those projects have turned into fruitful long-term collaborations.
