I have been involved in the development and implementation of the [Data Science for Social Good](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/data-science-for-social-good/) summer program. I have been a data science lead for projects with diverse stakeholders and I have had the wonderful opportunity to mentor teams of talented students:
