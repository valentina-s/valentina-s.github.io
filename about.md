I am a Senior Data Scientist and Data Science Fellow at the [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/), [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). As part of my role I collaborate with researchers from a wide range of domains on extracting information from large data sets of various modalities, such as time series, images, videos, audio, text, etc. I am involved in data science education for audiences at broad level of experience, and regularly teach workshops on introductory and advanced topics. I support open science and reproducible research, and strive to help others adopt better data science workflows.

**Research Interests:**

* Image Analysis
* Machine Learning for Ocean Acoustics
* Scientific Computing
* Reproducible Research Workflows
* Data Science for Social Good
